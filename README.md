Hexenwerk is meant to be an easy to use, well optimised and as modlike as possible datapack! <br>
It, however, is still in it's early ~beta~ alpha phases which means that there might still be bugs that haven't been fixed yet and it might be missing some features!
It also currently isn't survival compitable but that is subject to change! <br>
You can read more about singular features in the [wiki](https://github.com/Hexenwerk-Studios/hexenwerk-datapack/wiki/) <br>
