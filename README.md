## About The Project

### Prerequisites

Make sure to install all the recommended MCFunction development tools before developing for Hexenwerk!

### Installation

#### Installing a datapack to an existing world

1. In your world menu, find the world which you want to install the datapack on. Click **Edit**.
   ![The singleplayer menu](https://dph.tixte.co/r/install_guide_1.png)
2. Open the world folder.
   ![The edit menu](https://dph.tixte.co/r/install_guide_2.png)
3. In the world folder, open the `datapacks` folder.

4. Put the datapack zip file into the folder.
   ![zip folder in datapacks folder](https://dph.tixte.co/r/install_guide_4.png)
   > If the zip folder contains a folder which contains `data` and `pack.mcmeta`, then put that folder in the datapacks folder instead of the full zip. Putting the zip in the datapacks folder **only works** when `data` and `pack.mcmeta` are directly in the root folder of the zip.
5. Rejoin the world and run /reload.

#### Installing a datapack to an new world

1. Go to the Create New World screen. Make sure that you enable cheats.
   ![Create new world screen](https://dph.tixte.co/r/install_guide_6.png)
2. Navigate to the Data Packs screen. This is under the "More" tab in the latest versions.
   ![The Data Packs screen option](https://dph.tixte.co/r/install_guide_7.png)
3. Drag and drop the datapack zip into this screen.

   > If it doesn't show up, then it's likely that the zip file contains a folder which contains the datapack, and not the zip file just containing the datapack. You need to take the folder out of the datapack, and put it in the datapacks folder (click the `Open Packs Folder` button to open it.)
4. Click on the datapack icon to apply it to the world
   ![The Data Packs screen after I clicked the icon](https://dph.tixte.co/r/install_guide_9.png)
5. Create the world, and then run `/reload` in chat.

#### Installing a datapack to a realm

To install a datapack to a realm, you need to basically do this:

1. Download the world from the realm into your singleplayer worlds.
2. Follow the steps in "**Installing a datapack to an existing world**" to install a datapack on that world
3. Upload that world to your realm.
